Description:
============

A geometric animation using a set of circles rotating. At high intensity, it somewhat resembles a flame mandala, going from blue to red with increased intensity.


Instructions:
=============

Left click increases the intensity. This creates a new circle, a new nested circle, and moves the colour toward red.

Right click decreases the intensity. This removes a circle, one nested circle, and moves the colour toward blue.

Middle click toggles between a low setting and a high setting.


Known bugs/problems:
====================

The sizing and colour is not consistent after using the middle click to jump between increment sizes.
If you just left click to high intensity, then right click back, it's consistent.
If you use the toggle to set high intensity, you'll see different sizing and colouring as you right click toward low intensity.
